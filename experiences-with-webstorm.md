opening up webstorm was very fast
first thing it did was ask me about my key layout preferences
  it was cool to see that i could map it to use my eMacs keyset
it's weird to see that I can't create new files with a command t or command n
I haven't started to work with some of the specific portions fo the tool, but it seems very cool
i'm building a node web app
as soon as I started building out my package.json it provided me with the option to run npm install from a right click window
